# PUSH_SWAP

Another school project.

The goal of this project is to sort stack A using stack B.


The only difference from the known sorting methods is the presence of **special rules** of the algorithm and the **speed of execution.**

**Project was created on the [`MacOs`], so all Makefile's rules will be runned well only on this OS. 
If you use any of Linux distro's, you probably will face lot's of link problems. Sorry, eh!**  üá®üá¶ 

Make sure you've installed SDL.h
```
brew install sdl2
```
## Start
```
git clone https://github.com/ksnow-be/Push_swap.git; cd Push_swap; make;
```
## Use

Then, to execute the vizualization of the process run this magic [bash script](start.sh).

**./start.sh** VAL1 VAL2
  
```
Where:

VAL1 - start point of the randomizer
VAL2 - finish point of the randomizer

Please notice that the maximum amount of params can't be greather than 1000.
```
## Conclusion

So, this manual describes the fastest and most pleasant way to observe the execution of the algorithm.
If you are not a **42 student**, I think you are not interested in the details of the `push_swap` and `checker` programms.
If you are an **employee and consider this project as part of my resume** - all the details of the project I will explain to you at the meeting.
