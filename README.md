# PUSH_SWAP

Another school project.

The goal of this project is to sort stack A using stack B.


The only difference from the known sorting methods is the presence of **special rules** of the algorithm and the **speed of execution.**

**Project wa created on [`MacOs`], so all Makefile's rules will be runned well inly on this OS. 
If you use any of Linux distro's, you probably will face lot's of link problems. Sorry, eh!**  ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ 

Make sure you've installed SDL.h
```
brew install sdl2
```
## Start

`make`

If you are not a student of 42 , just run "./start.sh 1 100" (from 1 to 100 randoms), where you can handle 
the vis process of it by pressing RIGHT ARROW key. If you want make it quicker, just press LEFT ARROW key.

Make sure than you have installed SDL2 lib and command "make" is already done.

In other case, you know what to do.
