# PUSH_SWAP

Another school project.

The goal of this project is to sort stack A using stack B.


The only difference from the known sorting methods is the presence of **special rules** of the algorithm and the **speed of execution.**

**Project wa created on [`MacOs`], so all Makefile's rules will be runned well inly on this OS. 
If you use any of Linux distro's, you probably will face lot's of link problems. Sorry, eh!**  ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ 

Make sure you've installed SDL.h
```
brew install sdl2
```
## Start
```
git clone https://github.com/ksnow-be/Push_swap.git; cd Push_swap; make;
```
## Use

Then, to execute the vizualization of the process run this magic [bash script](start.sh).
```
./start.sh <VAL1> <VAL2>
Where:
VAL1 - start point of the randomizer
VAL2 - finish point of the randomizer
```

Make sure than you have installed SDL2 lib and command "make" is already done.

In other case, you know what to do.
